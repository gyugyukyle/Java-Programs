Jingle Bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.
Dashing through the snow

Jingle Bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.
Dashing through the snow

In a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way,
Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, j-j-jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!

In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, j-j-jingle bells,

Over the fields we go,

Laughing all the way,

Bells on bob-tail ring,
Making spirits bright,

A sleighing song tonight
